## About

The JobSearchApplication is a simple project for searching LinkedIn jobs based on a filter the user chooses.
After the user enters the filters in the GUI the results are saved in a *.csv file.

Note: the auto search in done without login credentials on LinkedIn website as web scrapping with an account 
is against LinkedIn TOS.

If you want to make changes to the *.csv file you can use my other project which can perform different operations on any *.csv : PandasDataFrame
https://github.com/Boschetzel/PandasDataFrame

Update : a GUI was implemented to view the results and allows user to filter them.
